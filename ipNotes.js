Everything in Unix is a file or a process. In Unix a file is just a destination for or a source of a stream of data. Thus a printer, for example, is a file and so is the screen.

A process is a program that is currently running.
"Everything is a file descriptor"
sockets:  a way to speak to other programs using standard Unix file descriptors.
